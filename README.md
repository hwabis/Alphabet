# Alphabet

Alphabet is a rhythm game written in SDL. It can load any Taiko beatmap from the rhythm game [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home). 

## Loading a map

First, make sure your map can be opened and played in osu!. (In other words, make sure the mapset .osz file is extracted.)

Then enter the map path; make sure to get the full name. For example, given an osu! installation in the default path, you could enter:

```
C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\osu!\Songs\1047505 cosMo@bousouP - Oceanus\cosMo@bousouP - Oceanus (Faputa) [Futsuu].osu
```

Also make sure you don't move the audio and image files out of the mapset folder, or the map could load incorrectly.

## Notes

This game is difficult compared to the traditional osu! gamemodes. Even if you are experienced in rhythm games, I'd suggest starting at a Futsuu difficulty or below. Scoring an S rank on a Muzukashii difficulty would be very impressive. :)
